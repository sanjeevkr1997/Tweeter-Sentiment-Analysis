# Tweeter-Sentiment-Analysis
## Problem Statement
Let’s go through the problem statement once as it is very crucial to understand the objective before working on the dataset. The problem statement is as follows:

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.
